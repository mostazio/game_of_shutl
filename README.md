# Game of Shutl

For our tech test, we'd like you to implement a stripped-down version of our quoting engine, and then add some features. This is a RESTful service endpoint that takes a few details and works out the price for a delivery.

Throughout the test we're looking for great ruby style, driving your code through tests (and refactoring) and at all times doing the bare minimum possible to get the job done. If you don't like the code that's there already, feel free to refactor as you add features.

Please don't spend more than 90 minutes on the test - it's fine not to complete all the features - just make sure that the features you do complete are done to a standard that you're happy with. Please complete the features in order.

To submit, fork our repo and add 'samsworldofno' as a collaborator. Bonus points for committing along the way and highlighting in your commit logs when a given feature was completed.

On the name: Our old tech test was the [game of life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) - but the Game of Shutl is much more interesting :)

## Completed Features

### Basic Service

Build a basic service that responds to a POST to /quotes, with the following request structure:

    {
      "quote": {
        "pickup_postcode": "SW1A 1AA",
        "delivery_postcode": "EC2A 3LT",
      }
    }

And responds with the following price:

    {
      "quote": {
        "pickup_postcode": "SW1A 1AA",
        "delivery_postcode": "EC2A 3LT",
        "price": 679
      }
    }


### Variable Prices By Distance

The price we charge depends on the distance between two postcodes. We won't implement postcode geocoding here, so instead let's use a basic formula for working out the price for a quote between two postcodes. The process is to take the base-36 integer of each postcode, substract the delivery postcode from the pickup postcode and then divide by 1000. If the result is negative, turn it into a positive.

Hint: in ruby, this would be:

    ("SW1A 1AA".to_i(36) - "EC2A 3LT".to_i(36)) / 1000

If you have a better idea for a deterministic way of making a number from two postcodes, please feel free to use that instead.

Update your service to calculate pricing based upon these rules.

## Pending Features

### Variable Prices By Vehicle

Our price changes based upon the vehicle. Implement a "vehicle" attribute on the request, that takes one of the following values, applying the appropriate markup:

* bicycle: 10%
* parcel_car: 20%

The vehicle should also be returned in the response.

### Vehicle Becomes Vehicle_Id

A change in requirements has come up - that vehicle is renamed vehicle_id.

In order to not break existing clients, you and the team have decided to add a header which will allow the client to specify the version of the API they want to use. Update your service to allow a header to be passed in, and to accept/show different the correct attribute depending on the version.

### Simple Volumetrics

Another feature of Shutl is that if the vehicle is not specifed, we calculate what vehicle is required based upon the volumetrics (weights and dimensions) of the product.

Update the service to accept an array of products, each of which is a hash, ie:

    {
      "quote": {
        "pickup_postcode": "SW1A 1AA",
        "delivery_postcode": "EC2A 3LT",
        "products" : [
          {
            weight: 10,
            width: 50,
            height: 50,
            length: 50
          }
        ]
      }
    }

Weight is specified in kilograms, dimensions in centimetres.

The service should then calculate the smallest possible vehicle which could be used for this job. The vehicle capacities are:

* bicycle: Weight 3kg, Capacity: L30 x W25 x H10 cm
* parcel_car: Weight: 50kg Max. Capacity: L100 x W100 x H75 cm

Don't worry about working out the vehicle if there are multiple products - assume there will always be only one.

### Complex Volumetrics

... assume no longer. Update your calculation that decides which vehicle should be used to deal with multiple products. You can assume that the volumetrics are simply to be summed together.
